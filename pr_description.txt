PR Title:
feat/FEAPP-420: Implement WhatsApp as a notification option

PR Description:
### WHAT:

This update adds a new, optional field for a customer's WhatsApp number in their user settings. If a number is provided, the system will now send all product notifications to their WhatsApp, in addition to their email. The existing email notification functionality remains unchanged.

### WHY:

This feature was implemented in direct response to customer feedback requesting more flexible notification options. By adding a widely-used platform like WhatsApp, we aim to improve how we communicate updates and boost user engagement with our products.

### Notes:

No changes to the local development workflow are introduced with this feature.
